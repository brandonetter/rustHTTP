  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  <p>
    This is a simple web page that uses a few different technologies to
    demonstrate how they can be used together. The technologies used are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>React</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These technologies are used to create a simple web page that displays a list
    of items. The list of items is stored in a JSON file and is read by the
    server when the page is loaded. The server then sends the list of items to
    the client, which displays them on the page.
  </p>
  <img src="/images/demoimage.jpg" alt="demo image" />
  <img src="/images/demoimage.jpg?q=20" alt="demo image" />
  <img src="/images/demoimage.jpg?w=300" alt="demo image" />
  <p>
    The page also includes a form that allows the user to add new items to the
    list. When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the server, which adds
    the new item to the list and sends the updated list back to the client.
  </p>

  <p>
    The page is styled using CSS, and includes some simple animations and
    transitions to make it more visually appealing. The page also includes some
    JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the page, such as handling form
    submissions and updating the list of items when new items are added.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, this page demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used
    together to create a simple web page that is both functional and visually
    appealing. It also demonstrates how Node.js, Express, and React can be used
    to create a server-side application that serves the page and handles data
    sent from the client.
